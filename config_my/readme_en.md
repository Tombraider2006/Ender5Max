This config after! installing the helper script with my edits.

If you want to repeat, then first you need to

1. install [helper script](https://guilouz.github.io/Creality-Helper-Script-Wiki/helper-script/helper-script-installation/)
2. install the items that are marked with green checkmarks. 1 2 4 5 6 7.
